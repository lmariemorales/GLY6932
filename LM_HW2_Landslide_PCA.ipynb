        "  A 1 in the \"Landslide\" column means there has been a landslide at that location.\n",
        "2. Make a copy of the landslide dataframe and remove the \"Landslide\" column using the df.drop() command. Normalize the data by subtracting the mean from each column and dividing by the standard deviation (I said variance in the video, please use standard dev). [1 point]\n",
        "3. Compute the correlation and covariance matrices of the normalized data using df.corr() and df.cov() (if you normalized correctly, these matrices should be the same). Make a colormap plots of these values using the pandas background_gradient function (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.io.formats.style.Styler.background_gradient.html). [1 point]\n",
        "4. Are there any variables that are strongly correlated? [1 point]\n",
        "5. Apply a PCA and determine the principal components (PCs) using the sklearn PCA fit_transform function (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html). Leave the n_components argument blank. This will default to keeping all components. [1 point]\n",
        "6. Make a scatter plot of PC1 vs. PC2. Remember that Python indexes from 0, so you will actually be plotting the 0 and 1 columns against each other. Use a different color for points that have a landslide. Make sure to include a legend. Describe any trends. [2 points]\n",
        "7. Determined the percent explained variance for each PC using the explained_variance_ratio_ attribute and make a scree plot (this is a plot showing PC# on the x axis and explained variance on the y axis). Label the x and y axes. [2 points]\n",
        "8. How many PCs would you need to capture at least 90% of the variance? [1 point]\n",
