        "\n",
        "The goal of this assignment is to implement logistic regression, quantify model performance, and interpret model outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Download landslide data using pandas.\n",
        "\n",
        "  The dataset can be found here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GatorGlaciology/Intro-to-ML-course/main/Complete-data.csv\n",
        "  \n",
        "  A 1 in the \"Landslide\" column means there has been a landslide at that location.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Apply the PCA analysis from HW2: Normalize the data by subtracting the mean from each column and dividing by the standard deviation. Apply a PCA and determine the principal components (PCs) using the sklearn PCA fit_transform function.  [1 point]\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Determine the number of landslides and non-landslides (0s and 1s) in the data. Do we need to worry about a class imbalance? [1 point]\n",
        "3. Using sklearn train_test_split, split the first 8 PCs into training and test sets, where the test set is 20% of the data set. Make sure this is randomized. [1 point]\n",
        "4. Perform a logistic regression on the training data. [1 point]\n",
        "5. Apply regression to test set using the predict() command. [1 point]\n",
        "6. Compute the accuracy for the test set and training set. Does there appear to be overfitting? [1 point]\n",
        "7. Make a confusion matrix for the test set. When predicting landslides, which metric (accuracy, true positive, false positive, etc.) do you think is most important to minimize or optimize? Discuss. [1 point]\n",
        "8. Apply the regression to the full dataset using the predict_proba() command. This will generate two data columns: 1) the probabilities of non-landslide occurrence, and 2) the probabilities of landslide occurrence. By \"full dataset,\" I mean the first 8 PCs before they were shuffled or sorted into a training and test set. Compute and plot the correlation matrix between each of the original (non-transformed) data variables and the output probabilities. [2 points]\n",
        "9. Based on the correlation matrix, which variables seem to carry the most weight in predicting landslides? [1 point]\n"
